    The Platform is about everything that is wrong in society. We allow the
    smallest group of people to take everything and get the leftovers handed
    down, little by little, to everyone else until there is nothing left. It
    shows how brutal this world can be and that is is WRONG! It is also a
    physological thriller and those are always fun.

<h3>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</h3>

    This is such a sad movie. Again, it is trying to right a wrong. It depicts a
    gruesome time in our history. It shows why this was so terrible. This movie
    will make you cry. It reminds me that humans are terrible beings and always
    have been. In a weird way, it makes me appreciate all the good people in my
    life.

<h3>My Sister's Keeper</h3>

    This movie came out when I was a young teenager. I have a younger sister who
    means the entire world to me. I know she was not born to keep me alive, but
    the love between the two sisters remindes me of our relationship.
